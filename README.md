This is a script I made for myself to turn a csv file of Chinese characters into Anki flash cards.

Requires [genanki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki).

Pinyin are from [Glosbe](https://glosbe.com/transliteration).

English translations are from [MyMemory](https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php) by Translated Labs.
